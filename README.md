Image Intelligence is a Landing Page website createdfor my dad. It utilizes Bootstrap 5.3, a popular front-end framework, along with CSS for styling. Additionally, you've incorporated the AOS package, which stands for "Animate On Scroll," to add scroll-based animations to enhance the user experience.

The website, Image Intelligence, likely focuses on some aspect of visual content or image-related services, given its name. With Bootstrap 5.3 as the foundation, the website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks great and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.

By using CSS, you have customized the appearance of the website, including the layout, typography, colors, and overall visual presentation. CSS allows you to style the different elements and create a visually appealing and coherent design.

The AOS package adds an extra touch of interactivity and engagement to the website. It provides you with pre-built animation effects that are triggered as the user scrolls through the content. These animations could include fade-ins, slide-ins, or other eye-catching transitions that occur when certain elements come into view.

By leveraging Bootstrap, CSS, and the AOS package, you have created a website that combines functionality, responsiveness, and visually appealing design with smooth scroll-based animations. This combination enhances the overall user experience and showcases the content or services offered by Image Intelligence in an engaging and professional manner.
